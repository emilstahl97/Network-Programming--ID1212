## Chat application using sockets

Your task is to write a simple chat program consisting of a server and a client where the server forwards incoming messages from a client to all other clients. Specifically regarding threads, they should be as follows:

ChatClient.java: Has two threads, one to listen for incoming messages from the server and one to send messages to the server.
ChatServer.java: Has one thread to each of the clients currently connected but also one thread to listen for new incoming connections from new clients.

There is no requirement to handle user login or chatrooms. Plain and simple.

### Extra assignment: 

Find and download a (simple) network sniffer, record some traffic from your chat and explain the TCP headers and flags. Compare with TCP-datagrams from other traffic for example your web browser.
